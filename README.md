# My Shell
Simplified shell project demonstrating basic command handling, I/O redirection, piping, and job control

## Key Features:

**Built-In Commands:** Supports essentials like cd and ls, enabling basic file and directory operations.

**I/O Redirection:** Supports input (<) and output (>, >>) redirection, allowing users to direct command outputs to files or use file content as command input.

**Piping:** Supports multiple pipes (|), letting the output of one command feed into another for complex operations.

**Job Control:** Supports background and suspended jobs with jobs and fg commands, enhancing multitasking within the shell.
